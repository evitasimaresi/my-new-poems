The house
House is a soft shelled pot
Is a pot of life
Move the pot
Life moves too!
And it moves fast
How livable are our pots!-
How livable is your pot?
How to blame?
Lets talk about the architect!
The architect is a curious specie camouflazing as an engineer
Soft ones
And the secret ones
Sitting on chairs and critisizing
